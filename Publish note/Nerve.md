# Nerve
A nerve transmits electrical impulses. It is the basic unit of the peripheral nervous system. 

- A nerve provides a common pathway for the electrochemical nerve impulses called [[action potentials]] that are transmitted along each of the [[axons]] to peripheral organs or, in the case of [[sensory nerves]], from the periphery back to the [[central nervous system]]. 
- Each axon, within the nerve, is an extension of an individual neuron, along with other supportive cells such as some [[Schwann cells]] that coat the axons in [[myelin]].
